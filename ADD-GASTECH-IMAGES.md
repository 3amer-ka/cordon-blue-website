# Adding Gastech CNG Project Images

## 📸 Image Setup Instructions

You have 4 excellent aerial photos of the Gastech CNG Mother Station project. Here's how to add them to your website:

### Step 1: Save the Images

Save your 4 Gastech images to: `images/projects/` folder with these names:

1. **gastech-main.jpg** - Use the completed station photo (4th image with blue roofs)
   - This will be the main hero image

2. **gastech-foundation.jpg** - Use the foundation/construction photo (1st image showing concrete foundations)
   - Shows the civil engineering foundation work

3. **gastech-aerial.jpg** - Use the aerial site view (2nd image showing full site layout)
   - Shows the complete site preparation

4. **gastech-compressor.jpg** - Use the compressor station area (3rd image with blue structures)
   - Shows the CNG compression and fueling area

5. **gastech-complete.jpg** - Use another angle of the completed facility (4th image)
   - Shows final completed infrastructure

### Step 2: Image Naming Guide

From your uploaded images:
- Image 1 (foundation work) → **gastech-foundation.jpg**
- Image 2 (aerial view) → **gastech-aerial.jpg**
- Image 3 (compressor area) → **gastech-compressor.jpg**
- Image 4 (completed) → **gastech-main.jpg** and **gastech-complete.jpg** (use same image or similar angle)

### Step 3: Quick Terminal Commands

```bash
# Navigate to projects folder
cd ~/Desktop/cordon-blue-website/images/projects/

# You can drag and drop the images here, or use cp command
# Example:
# cp ~/Desktop/gastech-image-1.jpg ./gastech-foundation.jpg
```
