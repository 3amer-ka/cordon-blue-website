## 🔧 Contact Form Enhancement

### Immediate Solution: FormSubmit (FREE, No Coding)

Edit `contact.html`, find the `<form>` tag and change it to:

```html
<form action="https://formsubmit.co/admin@cordonblueglobal.com" method="POST" class="contact-form" id="contactForm">
    <!-- Add these hidden inputs -->
    <input type="hidden" name="_subject" value="New inquiry from Cordon Blue website">
    <input type="hidden" name="_captcha" value="false">
    <input type="text" name="_honey" style="display:none">
    
    <!-- Rest of your form fields stay the same -->
</form>
```

Also update `js/main.js` - remove the `e.preventDefault()` line from the form submission handler (line 56).

**What this does:**
- ✅ Emails go directly to admin@cordonblueglobal.com
- ✅ No spam (honeypot protection)
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ 100% free

**First time setup:**
1. Submit a test form
2. FormSubmit sends confirmation email
3. Click confirmation link
4. All future submissions go straight to your inbox

## 📊 Optional: Add Google Analytics

Track your website visitors (FREE):

1. Go to: https://analytics.google.com
2. Create account (use admin@cordonblueglobal.com)
3. Get tracking ID (looks like: G-XXXXXXXXXX)
4. Add to every HTML file before `</head>`:

```html
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```
